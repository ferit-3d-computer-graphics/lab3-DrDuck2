# Lab 3: Meshes and Attributes

In this lab, you will learn how to construct and visualize 3D meshes, apply per-vertex and per-face attributes, and use color to encode scalar data across a surface. You will explore how geometric properties such as elevation and spatial location can be transformed into visual information through color mapping. Additionally, you will gain hands-on experience with animating mesh geometry to simulate dynamic behaviors such as waves or breathing surfaces. By the end of this lab, you will understand how mesh attributes enhance both the interpretability and visual richness of 3D graphics in data-driven applications.

Learning Objectives

After completing this lab, students will be able to:
- Build custom 3D meshes using vertex and triangle data.
- Apply scalar and vector attributes to influence rendering.
- Explore and compare visualizations using per-vertex and per-face (triangle) attributes.

# How to run notebook? 

Unfortunately, k3d extensions for Google Colab are in experimental phase, therefore you probably won't be able to run notebook on Google Colab
(widgets won't appear). 

# Installing Anaconda üêç and Running JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebooks

Follow these steps to install Anaconda and run your Python notebooks using either **JupyterLab** or **Jupyter Notebook**.

---

## Step 1: Download and Install Anaconda

1. Go to the official Anaconda website:  
   üëâ https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution

2. Download the **Anaconda Distribution** for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).

3. Run the installer:
   - On **Windows**: Use the .exe installer and follow the prompts (select "Add Anaconda to PATH" if prompted).
   - On **macOS/Linux**: Use the .pkg or .sh installer via Terminal and follow the on-screen instructions.

4. Once installation is complete, restart your computer (optional but recommended).

---

## Step 2: Launch Anaconda Navigator (GUI method)

1. Open **Anaconda Navigator** from your Start Menu (Windows) or Applications folder (macOS).
2. From the Navigator interface, you can launch:
   - **Jupyter Notebook**
   - **JupyterLab**

---

## Step 3: Launch JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebook (Terminal method)

1. Open **Anaconda Prompt** (Windows) or **Terminal** (macOS/Linux).
2. Your default web browser will open and show the interface.

---

## Step 4: Open and Run a Notebook

1. In the browser interface (Lab or Notebook), **navigate to the folder** containing your `.ipynb` file.
2. Click on the notebook to open it.
3. Run the cells using:
   - **Shift + Enter** to execute a cell.
   - The **"Run"** button in the toolbar.
